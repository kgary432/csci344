Please answer the following two questions:

What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful? 

A join is combining two tables based on certain data, usually where two data point match such as a user id number.


Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) 
to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?

Seperating the data prevent one table from getting too large to manage. In addition, it can help prevent future conflicts such as
losing a unique identifier if a user changes their first or last name.
